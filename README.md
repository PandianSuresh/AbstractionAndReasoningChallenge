# AbractAndReasoningChallenge

To run the program, first set the directory path according to how you have organized your folders in your pc. This is done at line 14 of ARC.py. Then run ARC.py. 

This program aims to answer the Abstracttion and Reasoning Challenge. In the current version, a simple semantic network is implemented. The nodes in the network are the symbols and the edges in the network represent relationship between the symbols. The input to the program is pairs of images which contain symbols which are transformed in some way between the input and the output. The program uses a simple segmentation scheme based on colour and spatial contiguity and extracts symbols. The program also attempts to identify the relationship between the symbols in terms of their relative position to other symbols and transformation.
